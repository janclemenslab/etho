# Config, protocol and playlist files
Protocol files and playlist files are ways to configure the system w/o messing with the code. Each file type has a specific role:
- **playlist** files control experiment flows - e.g. they allow to define a set of sounds to be played callback
- **protocol** files control hardware settings on a per-experiment basis - e.g. allow to set sampling rate or frame size
- **config** files control global hardware setting - e.g. user names, folder names etc.
