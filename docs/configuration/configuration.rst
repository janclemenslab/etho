Configuration

Protocol files and playlist files are ways to configure the system w/o messing with the code. Each file type has a specific role:

- `A global configuration <global.html>`__ file controls global hardware setting - e.g. user names, folder names etc.
- `Experiment protocols <protocol.html>`__ files control hardware settings on a per-experiment basis - e.g. allow to set sampling rate or frame size
- `Stimulus playlists <playlist.html>`__ files control experiment flows - e.g. they allow to define a set of sounds to be played
