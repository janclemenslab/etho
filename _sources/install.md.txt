# Installation
- Install conda if you do not have it. We recommend [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

## Python packages
Create conda environment, activate the environment and install the remaining pip packages:
```shell
mamba create python=3.10 numpy scipy h5py opencv pandas pyzmq gevent future pillow msgpack-python pyyaml pyserial ipython pip git defopt flammkuchen msgpack-numpy rich fabric psutil pydaqmx pyqtgraph qtpy pyside6 -c conda-forge -n etho -y
conda activate etho
pip install git+https://github.com/postpop/zerorpc-python git+https://github.com/janclemenslab/etho --no-deps
```

Modify versions if:

   - on the rpi PC: install `pandas=0.23` and `python=3.7`
   - you want to use the old flycapture SDK (required for some older FLIR/PointGrey cameras), install `python=3.6`

## Initialize the configuration and test
- Initialize config files and folders: `etho init`. This will:
   - `~/ethoconfig.yml` with the default [configuration](configuration/global.md)
   - create a `~/ethoconfig` folder with:
      - `playlists` folder with [stimulation playlists](configuration/playlist.md)
      - `protocol` folder with [experimental protocols](configuration/protocol.md)
      - `stim` folder for wav files
   - `~/data`

- Start the GUI: `etho gui`

<!--
## Set up passwordless SSH
First, open a terminal and execute the following command to generate public/private RSA key pair:
```
ssh-keygen
```
`ssh-keygen` generates public/private rsa key pair. You can click enter without entering anything for a default file location and empty passphrase.

Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\[username]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub if you didn’t change the file location.
Open id_rsa.pub with a text editor so that we can append the generated SSH public key to existing keys in the destination server.

Connect to the destination server using ssh and your password from PowerShell.
Open the “authorized_keys” file with an editor:
```
code ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Copy the contents of the “id_rsa.pub” (which was open in Notepad++) and append to the “authorized_keys” file in the server. -->
