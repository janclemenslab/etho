   - display frames with pyqtgraph: `mamba install pyqtgraph -c conda-forge`
- activate the new environment: `conda activate etho`
- install custom repos:
  - zerorpc fork (with support for numpy arrays): `pip install git+https://github.com/postpop/zerorpc-python --no-deps`
  - etho: `pip install git+https://github.com/janclemenslab/etho --no-deps`
- Test: `python -m etho.gui.wxCtrl`

## Set up passwordless SSH
First, open a terminal and execute the following command to generate public/private RSA key pair:
```
ssh-keygen
```
`ssh-keygen` generates public/private rsa key pair. You can click enter without entering anything for a default file location and empty passphrase.

Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\[username]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub if you didn’t change the file location.
Open id_rsa.pub with a text editor so that we can append the generated SSH public key to existing keys in the destination server.

Connect to the destination server using ssh and your password from PowerShell.
Open the “authorized_keys” file with an editor:
```
code ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Copy the contents of the “id_rsa.pub” (which was open in Notepad++) and append to the “authorized_keys” file in the server.
