# Global configuration
Global config via import `from . import config` via [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org), which reads the `ethoconfig.yaml` file in the `~/ethoconfig` directory.
```yaml
  python_exe: C:/Users/USER/miniconda3/python.exe # point to the python executable - used when starting the services. Can point to a python exe in a different environment. This global value can be overriden for each service in the protocol. That way, different services can run in different environments during the same experiment.
  playlistfolder: C:/Users/USER/ethoconfig/playlists
  protocolfolder: C:/Users/USER/ethoconfig/protocols
  stimfolder: C:/Users/USER/ethoconfig/stim  # folder for reading stimulus wav files specified in the playlists
  calibrationfolder: C:/Users/USER/ethoconfig/calibrations  # for saving calibration files (audio, opto, piezo) [FUTURE]
  savefolder: C:/Users/USER/data  # this is the parent directory for saving all videos, audios, logs etc.
  user: USER # default user for starting remote services via ssh [OPTIONAL]
```
