## TODO
- [ ] present logging information within gui
- [ ] make gui more responsive through async
- [ ] make protocols editable so small changes are more easily done (use traisui)
- [ ] refactor? ethoservice->services, ethomaster->master?
- [x] switch over to yaml for config reading (since this will preserve types)
- [x] installation instructions (where to copy `.ethoconfig.ini`)
- [x] copy ethoservice wiki
- [x] switch over to new zerorpc and pickle on localhost tasks
